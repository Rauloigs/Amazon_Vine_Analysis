# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The task is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. SellBy a company in this Amazon program pays a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

In this projects we are focusing in musical instruments reviews. The task will be done using PySpark to perform the ETL process, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Afterwards we will look for any positivity bias or negativity in the data set. 

Before showing the results you can see here the demanded data sets for this projects uploaded in pgAdmin. You will also see the pySpark session working properly in the **Google Colab**.

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

To be able to answer this questions we used the same AWS Music Instruments Data Set. And decided just to leave the rows where the total vote were greater than 20, in order to keeo our data relevant. You can see the code in the follwoing image:

1. How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?

**Total Vine Reviews:** 60

**Total non-Vine Reviews:** 14,477

2. How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

**Total Vine Reviews w/ 5 Starts:** 34

**Total non-Vine Reviews w/ 5 Starts:** 8,212

3. What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

**% Vine Reviews w/ 5 Starts:** 56.66

**% non-Vine Reviews w/ 5 Starts:** 56.72


## Summary: 

IÂ´m not sure if we have positivity bias. But certainly seems we could have it becuase we are observing over 55% 5 Star rate, which could be consider to be strange. It could be beacuse there where over 50% of 5 Star rates in the Vine Reviews, but I think it is neccessarily to run a test to realize if this expectations are true. In my opinion I could recommend to do a t-test or an ANOVA with more Data Sets that were already tested non-positivity biased to compare means and see the significance we have to assure our Vine Dataset was not positively influenced.
